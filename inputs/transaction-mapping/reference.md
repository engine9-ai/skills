# Transaction schema reference

Canonical documentation: [Frakture Transactions Data](https://frakture.notion.site/Frakture-Transactions-Data-442349ac436a4f7db8e7d732359e7d8f).

This file summarizes the schema as implemented in `interfaces/transaction/core/schema.js` and how the inbound transform and input-tools use it.

## Table: transaction

## recurs → recurs_id (inbound transform)

The transform maps `recurs` (string) to `recurs_id` (int) when not already set:

| recurs                        | recurs_id |
| ----------------------------- | --------- |
| 'daily'                       | 1         |
| 'weekly'                      | 2         |
| 'monthly'                     | 3         |
| 'quarterly'                   | 4         |
| 'annually'                    | 5         |
| 'semi-annually'               | 6         |
| (none) + recurring_number > 1 | 3         |
| (none)                        | 0         |

## Transaction entry_type → entry_type_id

From `input-tools/timelineTypes.js`:

| entry_type             | entry_type_id |
| ---------------------- | ------------- |
| TRANSACTION            | 10            |
| TRANSACTION_ONE_TIME   | 11            |
| TRANSACTION_INITIAL    | 12            |
| TRANSACTION_SUBSEQUENT | 13            |
| TRANSACTION_RECURRING  | 14            |
| TRANSACTION_REFUND     | 15            |

## Required fields from the mapper

The mapper must provide (the pipeline derives or resolves the rest):

- `ts`
- `amount`
- `remote_person_id` (3rd-party payer/donor identifier; pipeline resolves to `person_id`)
- `entry_type` or `entry_type_id`

The pipeline calculates `input_id` from `remote_page_name` or `remote_input_id`. The inbound transform uses `plugin_id` and `person_id` (resolved from `remote_person_id`) with `getTimelineEntryUUID` to set `id`. `plugin_id` serves as the UUID namespace. If `remote_entry_uuid` is set and valid, it is used as `id` and the composite is not needed.
